<h1 style="text-align: center;">Hospital Management System</h1>
<p>The Hospital Management System is a dynamic web application. In this project, HTML, Bootstrap, JDBC, Servlet, JSP, and JSTL libraries were utilized. The system consists of four modules:
  <b>Admin, Doctor, Appointment, and User</b>. In the Admin module, administrators can add doctors. Doctors do not have access to the admin panel. When a new user wishes to schedule an appointment, they first create an account and then log in to the application. After logging in, the user can fill out appointment details. The doctor will then receive the related user details</p>
